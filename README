To build both the send and receive programs, just type "make". 
Two binaries, send and rec will be created. You must have the
SDL and alsa development libraries to build this, otherwise
use the binaries provided. To terminate the programs right
now, you have to use Ctrl-c :( sorry about that, I will fix
this soon once finals are over!
